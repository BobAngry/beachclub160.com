							<h4>Laundry and Exercise rooms</h4>
							<div class="wrapper">
								<p class="pad_bot3">
									Open - 6AM to 10PM.  Note - the locks are electronically controlled and will lock and unlock automatically. 
									Please keep an eye on the time when working out or doing your laundry in the evenings. 							
							    </p>
							</div>
							<div class="wrapper under"></div>	
											
							<h4>Pool and Spa</h4>
							<p>
								Open - Dawn to dusk.  This is a State statute and for your safety. Also please be considerate of our pool side residents 
								when using the pool and tub area in the early morning or evening hours. Sound travels quite well over the water. 
						    </p>
							<div class="wrapper under "></div>	
																
							<h4>Dog ownership at Beach Club</h4>
							<p>
								You must walk your dog in the areas designated. You will have noticed the signs about cleaning up after your dog. 
								The board has received numerous complaints about poor dog ownership lately. Dogs should only be walked in the areas 
								designated and you must clean up after your pet. Violators will be fined when caught. Please be thoughtful of your 
								fellow residents and our landscaping crew. 
								<br /><br />
								The board has also heard complaints at the last board meeting of from neighbors of owners who have dogs that bark 
								constantly when their owners aren't home. Please be courteous of your neighboring units and if you don't know if 
								your dog is a problem, ask. While we currently do not have a size restriction on dogs, if a dog is labelled a 
								nuisance action can be taken. Contact Space Coast Property Management for questions or concerns. 					    
							</p>
							<div class="wrapper under "></div>	
																
							<h4>What to do in the event of a disturbance or noise complaint</h4>
							<p>
								First and foremost the Association desires all homeowners, tenants and invited guests to live peacefully and in harmony. 
								However in the event you encounter an issue the association suggests the following.  
								<br /><br />
								Contact the neighbor and politely speak to them on the issue. Many times people donâ€™t realize they are creating a 
								disturbance and once made aware of the issue will correct the issue.  
								<br /><br />
								Contact the police. If step 1 causes you concern and you feel it will only make the situation worse - call the police. 
								If you have spoken with the party causing the disturbance and they fail to comply - contact the police. 
								<br /><br /> 
								Inform the Association of the situation after the police have been contacted. If the police have been notified and 
								the problem continues contact the Association through the Property Management Office in writing of the complaint. 
								The address is posted on the marquee next to the club house.  
								<br /><br />
								Note - if the problem continues the police should be contacted again. Even if the first notification of the police 
								did not solve the problem they should always be the first level of notification. If possible ask the responding office 
								for a written summary of events. 
								<br /><br />
								For ongoing issues the association will investigate the problem. A written paper trail will be very helpful in resolving 
								and documenting issues, especially with a rental unit. Based on the findings the Association will take corrective action. 
								Please remember there are always two sides to every story and a resolution may require compromise on both parties. 					    
							</p>

							<h4>BBQ Grills are not allowed on patios</h4>
							<p>
								Reminder, as discussed at the last board meeting, gas and charcoal grills are not allowed on the patios (or breezeways). 
								Violators will be fined. This a major safety issue. Contact Space Coast Property Management if you have any questions or concerns.

								<p>
									The Beach Club 160 has contracted with Space Coast Property Management of Brevard, 
									Inc. (SCPM) to oversee maintenance and service contracts, assist with administrative 
									functions such as collection of association fees, processing of Architectural Review 
									request forms for submission to the ARC, and association document updates and meeting 
									support. SCPM is also the point of contact for covenant violation reports and reserving 
									the clubhouse for private parties.  The preferred contact is via email, as these are 
									more easily tracked for efficiency.  Of course, if there is an issue requiring immediate 
									attention, please do not hesitate to call.  Typical issues that should be handled by 
									SCPM and, at times, the Beach Club Walk Board of Directors, are detailed in specific 
									association documents.  Please become familiar with some of these situations so your 
									concerns are addressed as expediently as possible.
								</p>
								<p>
									Please know that SCPM and your Board of Directors are not liaisons between you, the 
									resident, and the police or fire department.  In the event of a non-HOA issue (such 
									as trespassers, vandals, fire hazards, etc.) please call the appropriate authority.  
									In the event of a life-threatening emergency, call 911 immediately!
